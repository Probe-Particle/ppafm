### Plans

 - plot how the site energy change with voltage x-V plot
   - what controls the curvature of the boundary E=0, parabola vs. hyperbola ?
 - Try to play with the Quadrupole rotation
 - Make headless script with plots it without the GUI  

### Problems

- the energy ploted by V1d and V2d (ax1, suplot(1,1)) is not the same as that in Site Enrgies (ax4, subplot(2,1))
